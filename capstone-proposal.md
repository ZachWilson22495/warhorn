Project's Purpose or Goal: A Tabletop RPG Assistant that manages turn-based combat by rolling for initiative of large groups, neatly sorting all participants, and keeping track of persistent effects.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
1. Create objects that are stored in an array.
2. Roll a random number between 1 and 20 on each separate object
3. Sort the array so objects are listed from highest roll to lowest roll

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
1. React

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
1. Highlight the 'character' at the top of the array.
2. Add an 'End Turn' button that moves the highlight to the next character on the array
3. 'Spectacle Roll.' Show each individual roll one at a time with styling/fanfare
4. 'Status Effect' tab on each character that shows current temporary status effects
5. 'Status Effect Countdown' to keep track of temp effect turns remaining
6. Notification when a temporary status effect expires

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
1. C# Backend
2. CSS
